# Time-Series
All files are taken from the Udemy course, 'Python for Time Series Data Analysis', by Jose Portilla.

## SUMMARY
- Use Python is primary language in this course.
- Work with time stamped data, using Pandas for data preparation
- Generate ACF and PACF charts together with ARIMA based models, including Exogenous data points.  
- Apply Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast future data points.
- Both ARIMA and RNN models predict time series data, using Sales dataset.
